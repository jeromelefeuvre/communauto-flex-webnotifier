# AI Assistant Instructions for Communauto Flex WebNotifier

### 1. 🚨 NEVER PUSH TO GIT (CRITICAL)
Under NO circumstances are you allowed to execute `git push` (to any branch or tag) or publish any code to a remote repository automatically. You may write code, run tests, and even `git commit` locally, but you **MUST explicitly ask the user for permission** to push before ever transmitting code to a remote server. Do not assume consent.

### 2. ✅ TEST COVERAGE FOR EVERY BUG AND FEATURE
For every bug fix or new feature discussed with the user, you **must** write or update Playwright tests (`tests/app.spec.js` or `tests/ui.spec.js`) that directly cover the changed behavior. Do not mark a feature complete or commit without a corresponding test that would catch a regression of that exact bug or feature.

### 3. 🧪 ALWAYS RUN TESTS BEFORE COMMITTING
Always run the complete Playwright E2E suite (`npm test`) to validate functionality and layout assertions before staging or committing any code changes. Ensure all tests pass natively without skipping.

### 4. 🛡️ CODE COVERAGE ARTIFACTS
Provide coverage feedback primarily via terminal console summaries rather than generating heavy file-based V8 reports.

### 5. ⚡ DYNAMIC CACHE BUSTING
When modifying UI or CSS files, honor the automated Node.js version-injection cache busting system (`server.mjs`). Do not manually append static `?v=` query strings to imports in `index.html`. Ensure `package.json` version bumps organically trigger the cache invalidation so Docker clients reliably receive fresh CSS assets.

### 6. 🏷️ GIT TAG CONVENTIONS
When creating release tags (e.g. `v1.3.0`), always use the established multi-line message format starting with `Release vX.Y.Z Summary:` followed by hyphenated commit-style bullet points detailing the changes (e.g., `- feat:`, `- fix:`, `- chore:`). Do not use single-sentence or abbreviated unformatted messages for release tags.

### 7. 🐳 DOCKER PRODUCTION VALIDATION
After all E2E Playwright tests pass cleanly locally, you must rigorously validate that the application is fully ready for production deployment by running `docker build -t communauto-car-notify .`. Do not commit code until the Docker container safely compiles without build errors.
